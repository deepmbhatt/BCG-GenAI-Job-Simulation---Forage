# 🤖 BCG GenAI Job Simulation - Forage 🌐

Welcome to my BCG GenAI Job Simulation repository! 🚀 This project represents my experience in developing an AI-powered (rule based prototype) financial chatbot, simulating a real-world task from the **BCG GenAI Consulting** team. This exercise allowed me to apply data science, Python programming, and AI to deliver insights from complex financial data. 🧠✨

---

## 📝 Overview
The **BCG GenAI Job Simulation** is a hands-on project designed to mimic tasks undertaken by BCG's GenAI Consulting team. In this simulation, I developed an AI-powered chatbot capable of analyzing complex financial data to provide user-friendly insights.

> **Project Date:** November 2024 \
> **Platform:** [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/)

### Project Highlights
- Developed a financial chatbot using **Python** and **pandas** for data manipulation.
- Parsed and analyzed financial data from **10-K and 10-Q reports**.
- Applied **rule-based logic** to extract and interpret key financial insights.

## 💡 Skills Applied
- **Python Programming** 🐍: Wrote scripts to handle data processing and logic for chatbot responses.
- **Data Manipulation with pandas** 📊: Cleaned and transformed financial datasets to enable meaningful analysis.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** 🗣️: Enabled chatbot to deliver clear and accurate financial insights.
- **Financial Data Analysis** 📑: Interpreted complex financial statements to develop value-driven insights.
- **AI & Rule-based Logic** 🤖: Created logical flows to ensure chatbot responses align with financial data.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
